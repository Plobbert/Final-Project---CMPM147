# Final Project - Crab Rave Simulator

Description: This program is a reactive display of geometric shapes. Once the user plays the song, they can move their mouse around to interact with the shapes by scaling and rotating them. The shapes also automatically react to the music being played based on the amplitude. Some shapes even change entirely depending on how intense the music is at the time.
